# First Time Deployment

## Software Prerequisites

To deploy ASKCOS, you must have the following installed on your machine:
* git
* Docker ([installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/install/))
* Docker Compose ([installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose))

## (Optional) Building Docker Images

Building the askcos-site Docker image is now more involved following the repository restructuring. We highly recommend
using the pre-built image from Docker Hub if you do not need to modify the code.

To only build askcos-site using a pre-built askcos-core image:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ASKCOS/askcos-site
$ cd askcos-site
$ make [TAG=my_tag]
```

A Makefile is provided to make it easier to build the image with a default image name.
You can also use the `docker build` command directly:
```bash
$ docker build -t <image name>:<tag> .
```

__NOTE:__ The image name should correspond with what exists in the `docker-compose.yml` file. By default, the image name is environment variable `ASKCOS_IMAGE_REGISTRY` + `askcos-site`. If you choose to use a custom image name, make sure to modify the `ASKCOS_IMAGE_REGISTRY` variable or the `docker-compose.yml` file accordingly.

Similarly, if you also want to build askcos-core:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ASKCOS/askcos-core
$ cd askcos-core
$ make [TAG=my_tag]
```

Note that you will need to specify the appropriate askcos-core version when building askcos-site afterwards:
```bash
$ cd askcos-core
$ make TAG=my_tag
$ cd ../askcos-site
$ make CORE_VERSION=my_tag TAG=my_tag
```

## Deploying the Web Application

Deployment is initiated by a bash script that runs a few docker-compose commands in a specific order.
Several database services need to be started first, and more importantly seeded with data, before other services 
(which rely on the availability of data in the database) can start.
The `deploy.sh` script is provided in the askcos-deploy repository and should be run as follows:

```bash
$ cd askcos-deploy
$ bash deploy.sh command [optional arguments]
```

There are a number of available commands, including the following for common deploy tasks:
* `deploy`: runs standard first-time deployment tasks, including `seed-db`
* `update`: pulls new docker image from GitLab repository and restarts all services
* `seed-db`: seed the database with default or custom data files
* `start`: start a deployment without performing first-time tasks
* `stop`: stop a running deployment
* `clean`: stop a running deployment and remove all docker containers

For a running deployment, new data can be seeded into the database using the `seed-db` command along with arguments
indicating the types of data to be seeded. Note that this will replace the existing data in the database.
The available arguments are as follows:
* `-b, --buyables`: specify buyables data to seed, either `default` or path to data file
* `-c, --chemicals`: specify chemicals data to seed, either `default` or path to data file
* `-x, --reactions`: specify reactions data to seed, either `default` or path to data file
* `-r, --retro-templates`: specify retrosynthetic templates to seed, either `default` or path to data file
* `-f, --forward-templates`: specify forward templates to seed, either `default` or path to data file

For example, to seed default buyables data and custom retrosynthetic pathways, run the following from the deploy folder:

```bash
$ bash deploy.sh seed-db --buyables default --retro-templates /path/to/my.retro.templates.json.gz
```

To update a deployment, run the following from the deploy folder:

```bash
$ bash deploy.sh update --version x.y.z
```

To stop a currently running application, run the following from the deploy folder:

```bash
$ bash deploy.sh stop
```

If you would like to clean up and remove everything from a previous deployment (__NOTE: you will lose user data__), run the following from the deploy folder:

```bash
$ bash deploy.sh clean
```

# Important Notes

## Recommended hardware

We recommend running this code on a machine with at least 8 compute cores (16 preferred) and 64 GB RAM (128 GB preferred).

## First startup

The celery worker will take a few minutes to start up (possibly up to 5 minutes; it reads a lot of data into memory from disk). The web app itself will be ready before this, however upon the first get request (only the first for each process) a few files will be read from disk, so expect a 10-15 second delay.

## Scaling Workers

Only 1 worker per queue is deployed by default with limited concurrency. This is not ideal for many-user demand. 
The scaling of each worker is defined at the top of the `deploy.sh` script. 
To scale a desired worker, change the appropriate value in `deploy.sh`, for example:
```
n_tb_c_worker=N          # Tree builder chiral worker
```

where N is the number of workers you want. Then run `bash deploy.sh start [-v <version>]`.

## Managing Django

If you'd like to manage the Django app (i.e. - run python manage.py ...), for example, to create an admin superuser, you can run commands in the _running_ app service (do this _after_ `docker-compose up`) as follows:

```bash
$ docker-compose exec app bash -c "python /usr/local/askcos-site/manage.py createsuperuser"
```

In this case you'll be presented an interactive prompt to create a superuser with your desired credentials.
